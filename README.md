Philosophy

The ultimate idea behind JS is an immense freedom, and, duct tape.
The language, being made by accident for the aims of ad-hoc scripting, now, is used for nearly anything in the world.
________________________________________
It is known that JS is influenced by Scheme. And this is a good part.
As it's predecessor, JS, surprisingly, has some neat properties.
For example, REPL. Have you ever debugged your JS in browser console?
Not to mention First-class functions, Closures, Prototypes e.t.c. JS, in it's very nature is a functional language, if to be compared with such beasts as Java.
________________________________________
But, that does not change the thing, that Web is a mess. And JS is a glue to stich everything together, and pray, that it would not fall apart.
So I would say JS to be the Duct Tape of the modern world.
________________________________________
Apart from Web being a mess. JS at it's core is not  bad. 
It has quite good capabilities. A very little of restrictions

Javascript
JavaScript is a client side technology, it is mainly used for gives client side validation, but it have lot of features such as;
 
•	JavaScript is a object-based scripting language.
•	Giving the user more control over the browser.
•	It Handling dates and time.
•	It Detecting the user's browser and OS,
•	It is light weighted.
•	JavaScript is a scripting language and it is not java.
•	JavaScript is interpreter based scripting language.
•	JavaScript is case sensitive.
•	JavaScript is object based language as it provides predefined objects. Every statement in javascript must be terminated with semicolon (;).
•	Most of the javascript control statements syntax is same as syntax of control statements in C language.
•	An important part of JavaScript is the ability to create new functions within scripts. Declare a function in JavaScript using function keyword.

Contrary to popular misconception, JavaScript is not "Interpreted Java". In a nutshell, JavaScript is a dynamic scripting language supporting prototype based object construction. The basic syntax is intentionally similar to both Java and C++ to reduce the number of new concepts required to learn the language. Language constructs, such as if statements, forand while loops, and switch and try ... catch blocks function the same as in these languages (or nearly so).

 JavaScript can function as both a procedural and an object oriented language.
Objects are created programmatically in JavaScript, by attaching methods and properties to otherwise empty objects at run time, as opposed to the syntactic class definitions common in compiled languages like C++ and Java. Once an object has been constructed it can be used as a blueprint (or prototype) for creating  similar objects.

 
Applications

1.Web  Development:
JavaScript is a client scripting language which is used for creating web pages. It is a standalone language developed in Netscape. It is used when a webpage is to be made dynamic and add special effects on pages like rollover, roll out and many types of graphics. It is mostly used by all websites for the purpose of validation.
2.Web Applications:
With technology browsers and personal computers have improved to an extent that a language was required to create robust web applications. When a user explores a map in Google Maps then the user just needs to click and drag the mouse. All detailed view is visible by just a click. This is possible due to JavaScript. It interacts with the browser without sending messages to and fro to the servers. JavaScript uses Application Programming Interfaces(APIs) that provide extra powers to the code.
3.Presentations:
JavaScript also provides the facility of creating presentations as a website. JavaScript provides RevealJS and BespokeJS libraries to build a web-based slide deck. 
 
4.Server Applications:
Node JS is built on Chrome’s Javascript runtime for building fast and scalable network applications. It uses event-driven, lightweight and efficient applications which are to be distributed over the systems with the help of a server. Javascript is used to handle HTTP requests and generate contents. 
6.Games:
Not only websites but uses of JavaScript also helps in creating games for leisure. The combination of JavaScript and HTML5 makes JavaScript popular in games development as well. It provides the Ease JS library which provides simple solutions for working with rich graphics.
7.Art:
Using the HTML5 in JavaScript drawing graphics on a web page has become easier. All two and three-dimensional shapes can be easily drawn on a canvas and this has opened the browser as a new medium for all different digital art projects. A canvas has no border and no content and hence lets the user create his own art.


Technology
1.  Three.js
Three.js is a cross-browser JavaScript library and Application Programming Interface (API) used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser. Three.js uses WebGL. The source code is hosted in a repository on GitHub.
Features
Three.js includes the following features:
•	Effects: Anaglyph, cross-eyed and parallax barrier.
•	Scenes: add and remove objects at run-time; fog
•	Cameras: perspective and orthographic; controllers: trackball, FPS, path and more..
•	Animation: armatures, forward kinematics, inverse kinematics, morph and keyframe.
•	Lights: ambient, direction, point and spot lights; shadows: cast and receive
•	Materials: Lambert, Phong, smooth shading, textures and more.
•	Shaders: access to full OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL) capabilities: lens flare, depth pass and extensive post-processing library.
•	Objects: meshes, particles, sprites, lines, ribbons, bones and more - all with Level of detail.

•	Data loaders: binary, image, JSON and scene.
•	Utilities: full set of time and 3D math functions including frustum, matrix, quaternion, UVs and more.
•	Export and import: utilities to create Three.js-compatible JSON files from within: Blender, openCTM, FBX, Max, and OBJ.
•	Support: API documentation is under construction, public forum and wiki in full operation.

2. HTML
Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <img /> and <input /> directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as <p> surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.
 

 
3. CSS
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript. 
CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.
    Application
1 . Compatibility : While using CSS, a user can be stress-free with its older language versions as it is well compatible even with the older versions.
2. Social Media Impact: Uses of CSS in HTML frameworks are also incorporated with the social media website developments as well. Facebook applications can directly correlate with the corresponding frameworks. 
3. Easy Accesibility: From the accessibility point of view, applications of CSS provides much better solutions that allow users to update the user interphase to suit the business requirements. 
4.Handling Dynamic Website Template: Dynamic Website Templates can be created and handled by uses of CSS in HTML framework and it basically helps while adding and editing web pages and elements to the web server and sites. By adding CSS extension to the concerned HTML pages and incorporating the same with the server-side templates, it makes easier to handle the dynamically allocated elements.
5.Image file handling: In the case of image handling, uses of CSS provides the styling Library, and this helps to output images along with the XML to the browser.
